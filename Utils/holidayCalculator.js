    // example of this is MayDay bank holiday, this is normally on the first monday of may, all of the things can then
    // be calculated for a given year.

    // as a result of this I suggest that it is best if the supplied parameter is the year that teh user want s all of the
    // public holidays for and then it just works out when all of the discrete (there are 8 potential bank holidays in the UK each year)
    // bank holidays are going to fall within that year, this will involve inspecting the date to see if it falls on a week day for some of them

    // The majority of the bank holidays are on a fixed date, the biggest issue will be calculating easter, however it is not a huge issue

    // passed.
